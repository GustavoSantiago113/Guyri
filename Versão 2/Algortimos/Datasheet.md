## 1. INTRODUCTION
<p>In order to avoid wasting money and resources while developing any project it is vital to design and size everything based on methods previously described for that. In agricultural field, that wouldn't be different. If a pivot is sized in a wrong way, it may lead to a colossal loss of water and consequently, energy. Pulling to energy side, if the number of solar panels is less than what is needed, you may face a lack of energy production. In the same level, if your composting or biodigesting process don't have enough materials, it won't work properly. With the purpose of avoiding all these problems, a good agricultural or biosystems engineer must know how to size and with the assistance of tools, the work gets more simple.</p>
<p>Usually an engineer uses the purest way to build something: a piece of paper, pencil and the knowledge. Later, people started to use excel sheets to entry values and obtain the outputs. But nowadays, with the advent and spread of digital technology, many softwares emerged and are being used to help in that task. However, an agricultural or a biosystems engineer has knowledge to size not only one kind of project aimed to rural interests but many ones, borning the need of a software that aggregates all those knowledge areas into one place. And it would be better if that place could be accessed with and without internet due to lack of internet signal at many rural places around the world.</p>
